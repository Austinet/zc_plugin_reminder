# ZC-REMINDER Frontend

## #team-darwin

## Repository Description

This folder serves as the repository for the Zuri.chat reminder plugin frontend and adheres to the style and contribution guidelines as listed in the parent repository - [Readme](https://github.com/zurichat/zc_plugin_reminder#readme)

## Repository Structure

This project uses [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for bootstrapping.

[Jest](https://archive.jestjs.io/docs/en/22.x/getting-started.html) for testing.

100% test coverage is the goal with shallow Enzyme assertions as minimum for components.\
Write tests for your components according to [Testing](#Testing)

## React Guidelines

### Basic Rules

- Functional components only!
- Functions are declared with ES6 [arrow function syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
- Only include one React component per file.
  - Multiple stateless components are allowed however.
- Use JSX syntax only.

### Naming

- Extensions: Use `.jsx` for React components and files containing JSX.
- Filenames: Use PascalCase for filenames. E.g., `DateCard.jsx`
- Reference Naming: Use PascalCase for React components and camelCase for their instances.

## Testing

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react) is used as test runner with [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) for assertion.

### Basic Rules

- Write tests to fail then update to pass. See [zc_plugin_reminder: Testing](https://github.com/zurichat/zc_plugin_reminder#testing)
- `test` is preferred over `it` in Jest as convention.

### Naming

- Tests are created on a component basis in `__test__`
- Tests are named in the format `<ComponentName>.test.js` and `<ComponentName>.test.jsx` for JSX files.

### Assertion

- Mock impure functions. See [Mocking Function](https://github.com/zurichat/zc_plugin_reminder#testing)

## Styling

- [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com/docs) is used for CSS styling.\
  Styles are declared using Tailwind utility classes.\
  E.g., `<div className="h-full flex flex-1 bg-blue-50"/>`

- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev) provides stock UI components.

### Tailwind

If you're new to Tailwind, instead of writing full length CSS styles you use shorthand descriptions of the styles.

For example, in rounding the top corners of an element, regular css would look like\
`border-top-left-radius: 0.125rem; border-top-right-radius: 0.125rem;`

In tailwind this is easily written with `rounded-t-sm`\
And you get to write the styles directly in your javascript so you don't have to deal with selectors, specificity etc.

Install the VSCode [Tailwind extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) to get suggestions and corrections on utility class names.

Check the [TailwindCSS Docs](tailwindcss.com/docs) for the full utility class list.

### Headless UI

Headless UI provides ready made components for use in building app UIs.\
Read the [docs](headlessui.dev) for more info.\

#### Usage

Import the required component from `@headlessui/react`

#### Styling

Headless components do not come styled out of the box. The components exposes render props you use to style them.
